algorithm A performs better than algorithm B (i.e. on average finds a lower cost solution given a budget of 1000
function evaluations)

[Alternate Hypothesis]
Algo A on average outperforms Algo B on problems 1-5 in terms of cost

[Null Hypothesis]
Algo A on average no better than Algo B on problems 1-5 in terms of cost
